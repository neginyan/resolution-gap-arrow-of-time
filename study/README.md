# Critical rate of entropy decrease for nonlinear flows — observation study (stages A–K)

Exact (quadrature) computation, no neural networks. Setting: Y = X + N(0, σ²I), dS/dt = r σ² tr F + Σ,
R = −Σ/(σ² tr F). Flow: pendulum f = (p, −sin q), κ = 1.

## Main observations
- Single Gaussian, divergence-free f (Stein's lemma): **R = tr(F Sym J̄)/tr F**, F = (S+σ²I)⁻¹, J̄ = E_ρ[Df].
  Matches quadrature to 4.3e-12 over 1675 cases; hence R ≤ λmax(Sym J̄) ≤ κ for Gaussian states.
  The key step is Stein's lemma, the same step as statistical linearisation in Gaussian-approximation filters: for Gaussian
  states the entropy production equals that of the flow linearised with the averaged Jacobian J̄. We do not claim it is new.
- Theorem 9 limit (c) is recovered at small σ (error O(σ²)); local stretch (b) and window-averaged stretch (d) do not track R.
- Two-component mixtures: component-wise law exact when components do not overlap; fails with overlap.
  An adversarial search finds R > max_k λmax(Sym E_k Df) (σ = 0.1, ratio 1.035). No case with R > κ was found (max R = 0.949).

## Stage B (mixtures)
- Exact three-term split for any state (second-order Tweedie, Cov(X|y) = σ²I − σ⁴H(y), H = −∇² log p_Y):
  R = tr(F Sym E_ρ[Df])/tr F (≤ λ_ρ) + E[tr((H − F) Sym E[Df|Y])]/tr F + D, with D the posterior Stein defect.
- R > max_k λmax(Sym E_k Df) comes entirely from the covariance term; it needs overlapping components of different widths
  (no separation required).
- Single Gaussian: R − e = −E_ρ[cos q] K_qq K_qp / tr F exactly, so |R − e| ≤ σ² |E_ρ a''|; overlapping mixtures break this bound.

## Stage C
- Adversarial search (K = 2, 3; 24 runs) aimed at valleys: largest R/κ = 0.946; a large excess (covariance + D) appears only
  when the law term is small. Valleys lower R at small σ and raise it at σ = 0.3–1.
- Maps of local stretch, local focus and the covariance-term density; D = D_within + D_between (exact) and a scale S_D.
- Quartic oscillator and double well: law 1 and the three-term split hold; R − e = −E_ρ[g'''] K_qq K_qp / tr F in general.

## Stage C+
- Pendulum: a + a'' = 1/2 pointwise, so E_ρ[a''] = 1/2 − λ_ρ. The sign of the felt curvature does not decide the sign of the
  covariance term (59% agreement). Excess ≤ κ − law in all 1536 pendulum states (max fraction of the room used 0.714).
- Balance bound: f ≤ B = E[|a| tr|H|]/E[tr H] (exact); B ≤ κ without valleys, but B > κ in 21 valley states.

## Stage D
- Grid aligned with the flow directions V, W (obs_eval2.vw_grid); agrees with the (q, p) grid to 6e-11 on all 2352 states.
- Pendulum: R ≤ 1 ⟺ M = E[(1−ā)H_vv] + E[(1+ā)H_ww] − D tr F ≥ 0 (M/tr F = 1 − R); both parts positive in all 1536 states.
- B′ = E[|ā|(tr|H| − 2(H_ww)_+)]/E[tr H] is an exact bound for the pendulum (= f without valleys); B′ + D > 1 only for the
  largest-R state. For flows with ā < 0 the W-version fails; a V/W-switching version holds.
- Near the top: largest excess found scales with distance with slope 1.43 (1.17 for distance ≤ 0.05).

## Stage E
- Verification: tolerant, non-destructive reproducibility checks; failed checks listed by name; tolerance usage reported (verification/vtools.py).
- Local search at distance 0.1–0.3: fraction excess/distance up to 0.9515 (R = 0.9854), still creeping, pinned at distance 0.3.
  Exact: fraction = [ρ·CV(u)·Ω·(1 − λ_ρ) + D]/distance, u = 1 − ā.
- Near the top (0.0003–0.003): fraction ≤ 0.090; envelope slope 0.98 there (1.26 overall).
- |cov| ≤ √Var(ā)·Ω (Cauchy–Schwarz, rms mismatch) holds everywhere; √Var(ā) = CV(u)(1 − λ_ρ) exactly.
- P_v, P_w stay positive under direct minimisation (min 0.00062 and 0.0176).

## Stage F
- Long local searches (distance 0.1–0.6, 6 × 2400 steps): fraction excess/distance up to 0.9838 (R = 0.9928); none above 1.
- The best states are a needle at the hyperbolic point carrying ~99.9 % of the Fisher information plus broad mass far from the top.
  Shrinking the needle (t → 0) drives the fraction to 1 from below (1 − fraction ∝ t) with R(mixture) < R(needle) < λ(needle) < 1.
- Nested partition-of-unity grid (f5_needle.composite) for needles 100× narrower than the rest; the uniform V/W grid hits its
  2401-point cap there (error ~1e-7).
- R of a mixture can exceed the best single component's R (382 of 1671 states), but only by ≤ 7.8e-6 when that R ≥ 0.95.

## Stage G
- Two needles at the top (pendulum): same-shape needles always lower R (R ≤ max_k R_k); the loss is first order in
  (offset from the top)² and in Δā (equivalent at a flat top). Concentric needles of different shape raise R slightly:
  excess, gap 1 − max_k R_k and Δā all scale as σ¹, with excess/gap ≤ 0.027; shifting a needle off the top lowers this as δ².
- Every stored state (1591) satisfies R ≤ R*(σ), the best single Gaussian at the same window (largest (R − R*)/(1 − R*) = −0.057);
  1 − R*(σ) = σ(1 + O(σ)), from a needle at the top with s_w² ≈ 4σ.
- Nested-grid recheck of all 49 states where the uniform V/W grid is capped: largest change 1.9e-7, no conclusion changes.
- Needle limit: 1 − ρ·CV·Ω = c₀ + c·t with c = 2(S_vv + σ₀²)/S_ww + (−cos q_k) S_ww/(8(1 − λ_ρ₀)) from law 1
  (0.011832 vs measured 0.011830).

## Stage H
- True best single Gaussian: by law 1, R = λφ with φ independent of the V/W off-diagonal, so the optimum is a zero-width segment
  through the top, tilted from W towards −V by ≈ σ/4, half-length ≈ 2√σ. One-dimensional problem; the inner optimum is
  p* = 2/(1 + √(1 + 4σ/u)). Exact series: 1 − R* = σ − 7/8 σ² + 65/96 σ³ − 61/128 σ⁴ + … (rational coefficients to σ¹¹).
  Above σ_c = 0.93909 the supremum is the long-needle limit 1/2. The stage-G optimisation had already found R* (to 5e-14).
- R ≤ R*(σ) is FALSE: mixtures of thin segments crossing at the top with slightly different tilts (a fan) exceed R* by
  1–5 % of 1 − R* (g* up to 0.053 for K = 8; a symmetric fan levels off at 0.044), scale invariant, confirmed by two independent
  evaluators (Gauss–Hermite posterior; direct kernel summation). R < 1 throughout and (1 − R)/σ ≥ 0.95.

## Stage I
- Continuous fan (17-parameter functional family, Chebyshev series in the angle): g* = 0.0478, unchanged from 20 to 80 segments,
  scale invariant; the free K = 8 mixture of stage H (0.053) stays slightly above. Pendulum: 1 − R ≥ ~0.95σ observed.
- Lower-bound scaffold: exact identity J_tot(1 − f) = E[g H_vv] − E[g H_ww] + 2J_ww (g = 1 − ā) plus one inequality from
  H ≤ I/σ² (a bathtub bound on where the V-focus can sit): a rigorous state-wise bound, tight for single Gaussians, ≥ 0.767σ on
  all 290 states (actual ≥ 0.946σ). With full weight a line-wise Cramér–Rao inequality along W closes it with c ≈ 1.
- Other flows: κ − R* = 2√(2βκ) σ + O(σ²), β = decay of the stretch along W (pendulum 1/8, double well 3/4, quartic 3/4,
  twist 3/8); polynomial tops give a universal closed form (v* = √(4 + 9ε²) − 3ε, ε = σ√(b/κ)). In the twist flow
  H = ½ ln(1 + q² + p²) the stretching direction turns; a curved needle (curvature = turning rate 1/√2) removes the turning part
  of β and the gap drops from (√3/2)σ to 0.509σ (prediction σ/2); still ∝ σ, R < κ.
- verification/vtools.reproduce(..., loose=...) compares outputs of iterative fits / argmax locations with their own tolerances.

## Stage J
- State-wise theorem (pendulum): 1 − R ≥ Θ′σ/(1 + Θ′σ/2) − ε̃ − D (ε̃ = ε j/(σ²J_tot); corrected in stage K), from the exact identity, sin²(x/2) ≥ x²/4 − x⁴/48,
  a weighted Cramér–Rao inequality along W (Cauchy–Schwarz with the V-focus weight w = σ²(H_vv)₊ ≤ 1) and H ≤ I/σ².
  Θ′ = (|E[w u s_w]|/E[w]) √(J_ww/E[w s_w²]), u = √2 (m_q − π).  Over all 290 states: bound ≥ 0.898σ (closed form) /
  0.909σ (integral form) against actual ≥ 0.946σ (stage I: 0.767σ); Θ′ ≥ 0.9125 on all states with σ ≤ 10⁻².
- Not proved: a state-independent lower bound on Θ′ (the focus-slope term E[u ∂_w w], i.e. third derivatives of log p_Y,
  is not controlled by H ≤ I/σ²).  For priors on a single line along W (j = 1), Θ′ = 1 − σ²J_ww and c → 1.

## Stage K
- Corrected step 6 of the stage-J chain: the positive part of the numerator is divided by J_tot ≤ j/σ² + J_ww, the ε part by J_tot
  exactly — no sign condition (numbers unchanged: 0.8978 → 0.8977).
- Smoothed focus weight χ ≤ w with √χ (λ√J_ww/2)-Lipschitz along W removes the focus-slope term: 1 − R ≥ T/(1 + T/κ₂) − ε₂ − D,
  T = Θ_χ σ √(κ₂/2), Θ_χ = α G_χ/(1 + λ√P_χ). Conditional uniform bound in terms of α, G_χ, κ₂, ε₂; on the 236 near-top states
  c = 0.344 (λ = 1), state-wise ≥ 0.389σ. No unconditional c for K ≥ 2 (K = 1: 1 − R ≥ 1 − R*(σ) exactly).
