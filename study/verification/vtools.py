"""Shared helpers for the verification scripts.

- check(name, ok, info, value=None, tol=None): records the result; with value/tol it also records the margin value/tol.
- finish(): prints the names of all failed checks, the checks whose value uses more than 10 % of the tolerance ("tight"),
  and exits with code 0 iff everything passed.
- reproduce(path, script, rtol, loose): re-runs a summary script WITHOUT changing the stored summary (the file is restored afterwards) and
  compares old and new numbers with a relative tolerance of 1e-9 (absolute 1e-12). Exact equality is not required: the last
  bits of floating-point sums can differ between machines / BLAS builds, and an earlier exact comparison that also overwrote
  the stored file explains a single, non-reproducible failure on another machine.
